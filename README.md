# osu-ai
My attempt trying to use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to play osu!
Programmed in Python
Modules/software (most likely) being used:
* pyTorch
* openCV - object detection
* numPy
* PySide2
* PyQt5 - for gui
* win32api - simulating inputs


Inspiration taken from:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXA7zXVz8A4&t=405s 
* https://github.com/GuiBrandt/OsuLearn

## Step By Step goals:
* Grab inputs
* Edge detection on images
* Capture gameplay live
* OpenCV template matching to find cursor
* Train dataset with screenshots with (x,y) coordinates
* Train neural network with this data, using backpropogation


(will possibly include more detailed steps of process)
