# osu-ai
My attempt trying to use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to play osu!
Programmed in Python
Modules/software (most likely) being used:
* pyTorch / TensorFlow and Keras
* openCV - object detection
* numPy
* win32api - simulating inputs

* First version of this program will focus on mouse movement
* Second time around, an attempt will be made to train a function with key presses included


Inspiration taken from:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXA7zXVz8A4&t=405s 
* https://github.com/GuiBrandt/OsuLearn
* ClarityCoders

## Step By Step goals:
* <s>Grab inputs</s>
* <s>Edge detection on images</s>
* <s>Capture gameplay live</s>
* <s>OpenCV template matching to find cursor</s>
* <s>Pass image from getScreen.py to the template matching function </s>
* Label and store the images, using the previous coordinates
* Train neural network with this data, using backpropogation algorithm


(will possibly include more detailed steps of process)
