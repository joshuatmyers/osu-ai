# osu-ai
My attempt trying to use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to play osu!
Programmed in Python
Modules/software (most likely) being used:
* pyTorch
* openCV
* numPy
* PySide2


Inspiration taken from:
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXA7zXVz8A4&t=405s 
* https://github.com/GuiBrandt/OsuLearn

## Step By Step goals:
* Get mouse position
* Edge detection on images
* Capture gameplay live
* Train dataset
* Detect objects live
* Move mouse towards objects/ changing mouse position

(will possibly include more detailed steps of process)
