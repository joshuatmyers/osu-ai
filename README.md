# osu-ai
My attempt trying to use Machine Learning and Computer Vision to play osu!
Programmed in Python
Modules/software (most likely) being used:
pyTorch
openCV - object detection
numPy
PySide2
PyQt5 - for gui
win32api - inputs

Big inspiration taken from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXA7zXVz8A4&t=405s and https://github.com/GuiBrandt/OsuLearn

## Step By Step goals:
* Capture gameplay live
* Detect objects live
* Move mouse towards objects

(will possibly include more detailed steps of process)
