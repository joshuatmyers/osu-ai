# Plans for getData.py

# capture osu! window
# apply grayscale and filter to reduce size

# Inside a while loop:
# take a screenshot
# take current mouse position => append to array
# take current keys pressed => append to different array
# check if button has been pressed to stop taking data

# Labelling images:
# loop through all images
# attach mouse pos (x,y) to name of image
